Levels:
The agents come in waves. Each level spawns more agents and
has a higher spawn rate than the last.There is a short gap between
each level.

Funds:
Each level grants funds (increasing each level to a max of $2500)
when complete. These funds can be used to purchase new towers, upgrades,
or the Nuke if you are feeling particularly destructive.

Purchasing new towers:
A Bullet Tower costs $2500, and a Radius Tower costs $2000.
They are placed randomly
within the gameplay area.

Upgrades:
Upgrading a tower costs $500. The tower is chosen randomly.
You can see which tower got upgraded as it increases slightly in size.
Larger towers are therefore stronger.
Upgrading Radius Towers increases damage radius, and slightly
increases damage amount and rate.
Upgrade Bullet Towers increase fire rate, and slightly increases
damage amount, accuracy and lock-on radius.

Nuke:
Costs $10000. Destroys every Agent on screen. Does not necessarily
mean you complete the level as there may still be Agents to be spawned.

Area of effect:
A pulsing circle around radius towers, showing their area of
effect as well as their rate of damage (previously it was difficult
to tell when they were actually doing damage)

Moving camera:
Camera angle slowly changes within a fixed range
to make the game feel less static.

Extra sound effects:
* a different one for each Agent type when spawned
* for the Nuke
* for when an Agent reaches your base
* for the Game Over screen

High score: 
Keeps track of high score after resets.
